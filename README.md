# WooCommerce Subscriptions - Cancel on Refund

Cancel a subscription when its parent order or last renewal order is fully refunded.

The subscription will be transitioned immediately to the _cancelled_ status. It will not go via _pending cancellation_.

If the refund is not on the most recent order, the subscription will not be cancelled. For example, if a subscription has both a renewal order and a parent order, and only the parent order is refunded.
